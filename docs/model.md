# AI Model Overview

This document provides details about the AI models used by Biocommunicator for interpreting signals from nature.

## Model Architecture
The model leverages [model type, e.g., CNN or RNN] architecture for signal analysis and response generation.

## Training and Evaluation
1. **Training Data**: [Specify your data source, e.g., sensor data, plant/animal signals].
2. **Model Training**: [Include training methods, e.g., supervised learning, reinforcement learning].
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.

### Example Code:
```python
# Example of model training with sklearn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
