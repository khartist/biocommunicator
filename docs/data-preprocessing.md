# Data Preprocessing

Biocommunicator relies on clean and well-structured data for optimal performance. This document outlines the steps involved in data preprocessing.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features from raw data to improve model performance.
3. **Data Transformation**: Scaling or normalizing data for consistent input into models.

### Example Code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(df):
    df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
    df = df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove duplicates
    return df
```
