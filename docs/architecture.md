# System Architecture

Biocommunicator is designed with modular components to facilitate communication with nature through AI models. Here's an overview of the system:

## Layers:
1. **Data Layer**: Handles data collection and preprocessing, ensuring clean and standardized input.
2. **AI Model Layer**: Responsible for interpreting signals from nature and generating responses.
3. **User Interface Layer**: Provides a front-end interface for users to interact with the AI.

## Data Flow:
Data is collected, cleaned, and sent through the AI models for analysis. The results are displayed in real-time through the user interface.
