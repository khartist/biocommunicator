# Biocommunicator


**Biocommunicator** is an AI-powered project designed to interpret signals from plants and animals, allowing for better understanding and interaction with the natural world. This project is in its early stages (MVP), aiming to develop a platform where machine learning models process data from living organisms and turn it into meaningful insights.

## üöÄ Project Vision

Biocommunicator‚Äôs goal is to revolutionize how we communicate with the natural environment by leveraging AI to interpret bio-signals from plants and animals. The long-term vision is to enable seamless, bidirectional communication with nature.

## üîß Features

- **AI-based Signal Interpretation**: Process raw biological data and interpret meaningful signals.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Input raw signals and view interpreted results through a simple UI.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable for additional signal types, organisms, or environments.

## üìã MVP Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather bio-signals from plants and animals.
2. **Signal Processing**: Use machine learning to interpret these signals.
3. **User Interface**: Provide a frontend for users to input and analyze data.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow, Python
- **Development Tools**: Docker, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## üß† How It Works

The Biocommunicator system is designed to collect biological signals from sensors and process them through an AI model. These signals are then interpreted and displayed in a user-friendly interface.

1. **Input**: Bio-signals are fed into the system.
2. **Processing**: The AI model analyzes the signals.
3. **Output**: Interpreted data is shown to the user (e.g., a plant's stress level).

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

To get started with Biocommunicator locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/tom-boyle/biocommunicator.git
cd biocommunicator

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Ensure you have Python, Docker, and Node.js installed on your machine. Then, set up the required dependencies:

- **Backend:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Frontend:**
    cd frontend
    npm install

### 3. Run the Application
